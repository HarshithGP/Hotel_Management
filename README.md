# Hotel_Management
First Coding Project in Java on a Hotel Management System. Leaded a team of 4(myself included) to develop Java code for a Computer Science project in Grade 12.

The code is designed to handle Hotel transactions such as
Room Bookings, Check Ins, Check Outs, Club and Restaurant services.

Developed the code during the 12th Grade as a team of 4.

As the leader, it was my responsibility to ensure that we met all the deadlines and integrated our ideas into a consolidated Project.
